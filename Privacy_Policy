NEARSECURE PRIVACY POLICY

THIS APP DOES NOT STORE ANY DATA OUTSIDE YOUR DEVICE. PERIOD. 

It physically can't. We don't pay for a server database. We're grad students who made this app for a project. We're not interested in paying for that, or honestly any of your data.  We just want a good grade.

This app uses your location to provide you with context for when your device received NFC signals. It doesn't send it anywhere. We used OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) data to display the map, which is open source as well.

Did you use NFC payment at the store, or shared data with a friend? Cool. Repeatedly pinged at the park? Not so much. This app lets you know what your device is doing, but doesn't tell anyone else.

Don't believe us? Check our code - you're already at the GitHub page.
